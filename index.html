            <h3 id="top">Olive Ridley turtles</h3>
            <p>The Olive ridley turtles are the smallest and most abundant of all sea turtles found in the world, 
              inhabiting warm waters of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans. These turtles, along with their cousin the Kemps ridley turtle, 
              are best known for their unique mass nesting called Arribada, where thousands of females come together on the same beach to lay eggs. 
              Though found in abundance, their numbers have been declining over the past few years, and the species is recognized as Vulnerable by the 
              IUCN Red list.
              <br>
              Growing to about 2 feet in length, and 50 kg in weight, the Olive ridley gets its name from its olive colored carapace, 
              which is heart-shaped and rounded. Males and females grow to the same size; however, females have a slightly more rounded carapace as 
              compared to the male. They are carnivores, and feed mainly on jellyfish, shrimp, snails, crabs, molluscs and a variety of fish and their eggs. 
              These turtles spend their entire lives in the ocean, and migrate thousands of kilometers between feeding and mating grounds in the course of 
              a year.
              <br>
              Interestingly, females return to the very same beach from where they first hatched, to lay their eggs. During this phenomenal nesting, 
              up to 600,000 and more females emerge from the waters, over a period of five to seven days, to lay eggs. They lay their eggs in conical 
              nests about one and a half feet deep which they laboriously dig with their hind flippers. The coast of Orissa in India is the largest mass 
              nesting site for the Olive-ridley, followed by the coasts of Mexico and Costa Rica. After about 45-65 days, the eggs begin to hatch, and
              these beaches are swamped with crawling Olive-ridley turtle babies, making their first trek towards the vast ocean. During this trek they 
              are exposed to predators like jackals, birds, hyenas, fiddler crabs, and feral dogs lurking around, waiting to feed on them. WWF-India,
              along with the fishermen community, has been involved in protecting the Olive ridley rookery at the mass nesting site at Rushikulaya, 
              in Orissa, by fencing off the nesting area and patrolling it till hatching and ensuring a safe passage for the hatchlings to the sea.
              It is estimated that approximately 1 hatchling survives to reach adulthood for every 1000 hatchlings that enter the sea waters. 
              This may also be the reason why arribadas happen and a single female can lay 80 to 120 eggs and sometimes even twice in a season;
              to increase the hatchlings survival rate.
